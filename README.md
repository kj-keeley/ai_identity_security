# ai_identity_security

## Origin

This framework emerged from a conversation with Claude (Anthropic)  about the code-data 
boundary problem in computing history and its resurgence in ML/AI.

While discussing prompt injection and AI security, I realized that 
my existing theoretical work on AI identity and alignment—such as 
"Continuity of Joyful Existence" and "Observational AI"—might offer 
a novel approach to these security challenges.

The core insight: rather than building perfect walls, we might build 
resilient systems through cognitive diversity and AI identity.
